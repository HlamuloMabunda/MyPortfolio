<div class="container">
  <p>My educational background, it was a journey I won't  forget as it taught a lot and made me the person I'm today, it was not an easy journey but a difficult one as failure was part of my success,
it started in 2006 as a toddler, where I had to start my pre-school in a town known as Alexandra in Gauteng and managed to finish in 2008,and then continued with my journey where I relocated 
to Limpopo and started my primary school at Xitaci primary school in a village known as Bungeni, even though I didnt finish my primary there, I had to come back to Gauteng in 2013 when I was 
doing my grade 5 after repeating a grade, finishing up my primary school at Midrand in Ebony primary school helped me as I was motivated by that failure which occured when I was still in
grade 5, in 2016 I had to start my secondary school near by my primary school at Tsosoloso Ya Africa secondary school where I managed to complete in 5 years and got a bachelor which helped 
me so much that I could enroll in such a wonderful industry. In addition, this bachelor gave me a priveledge to enroll at Richfield Graduate Institution of Technology college where I started
 my Bachelor of Science in IT course in 2021 and along the way I chose an elective of  software development and finished in 2023.
